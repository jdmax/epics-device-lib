"""Socket-backed stand-in for the stdlib telnetlib removed in Python 3.13.

PEP 594 dropped telnetlib from the standard library in 3.13, which would
otherwise strand every Telnet driver in this package. None of the instruments
here are actually Telnet servers -- they sit on serial-to-Ethernet adapter
channels (ports 1001-1003, 4444, 5555, ...) that carry raw bytes -- so what the
drivers really need is a socket with a buffer and a delimiter search, which is
all this provides.

Only the three calls the drivers use are implemented, with the same signatures
and the same return contracts as the stdlib class, so no driver has to change:

    write(buffer)                 -> None
    read_until(expected, timeout) -> bytes, up to and including expected
    expect(patterns, timeout)     -> (index, match, text)

Both readers return whatever is buffered rather than raising when they time out,
matching telnetlib, and both leave anything past the match in the buffer for the
next call.

Telnet option negotiation is refused rather than ignored: an adapter that has
been configured for Telnet rather than raw TCP will open with IAC sequences, and
letting those bytes reach a driver's regex would be a confusing failure. That
mirrors what telnetlib did with no option callback installed.
